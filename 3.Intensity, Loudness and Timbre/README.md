- In the frequency domain the range of human hearing is between approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz. 
- In the intensity domain there is roughly 120 dB dynamic range. 

Loudness
---
- Subjective perception of sound intensity
- Depends on duration / frequency of a sound
- Depends on age
- Measured in phons
- 3db duraton 1000ms loudness > 3db duration 600ms loudness

Timbre
---
- Colour of sound / tone colour
- quality of sound /tone quality
- same intensity, frequency, duration, what is the the differene between two sound ? That is Timbre
